# Multithreaded-Java-WebServer

Welcome, this repo hosts a webserver purelay implemented in Java without relying heavily on preexisting libraries or frameworks. The aim of this exercise was to setup a whole end-to-end project in Java 8 and thereby ensuring that key technical features such as Etag, GZip, Mime-Types are implemented. Furthermore basic multithreading was implemented to allow users to access the server simultaneously.
